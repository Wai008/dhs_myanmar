## Demographics

::: aside
-   52 million population with \~ 135 ethnic groups. Has 7 states and 7 regions.
-   "Bamar" in regions and "\>100 ethnic groups" in states

## Ethnicity

::: aside
-   52 million population with \~ 135 ethnic groups. Has 7 states and 7 regions.
-   "Bamar" in regions and "\>100 ethnic groups" in states

## Research Question

::: incremental
-   How do demographic characteristics influence contraceptive knowledge, practices and unmet need among currently married women aged 15-49 in Myanmar?

-   Are there any contraceptive disparities between States and Regions?

-   Bonus info: What are the *most used contraceptive methods*?
:::

## Dataset

DHS Myanmar dataset 2016

-   7870 observations and 26 variables
-   All participants are currently married women aged 15-49

Key variables:

-   Demographic characteristics: age (5-yr group), location (region/state), residence (urban/rural), education, wealth index

-   Outcome: contraceptive knowledge, practice, unmet need

## Key messages

::: incremental
1.  Is it true that there are health inequities between states and regions?

-   The answer is **YES**.

2.  Why and How can we address this issue?

-   I suppose this is what the scholars have to find out.

3.  **Global health** is an area for study, research, and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving *equity in health* for all people worldwide.
